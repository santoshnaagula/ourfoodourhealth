      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>Kangen H2 water converts toxic hydroxyl radicals to water (H2 + 2 * OH -> 2H2O), making it an extremely
          antioxidant-rich water and free-radical scavenger!</li>
        <li>Powers the bio-electricity of normal healthy cells with over -400 millivolts. Around -20 to -25 millivolts
          for normal healthy operation. Cell repair and healing need a higher level environment of about -50 millivolts.
          ⚡
        </li>
        <li>It maintains the homeostatic levels of our body's antioxidants (e.g. glutathione). 💪🤪</li>
        <li>Benefits the cells by signaling cell metabolism, gene expression; which gives an anti-inflammatory,

      <h3>"You Cannot Eat Enough Fruits & Vegetables in One Day to Come Anywhere Near the Antioxidant Power of Just One
        8oz. Glass of Kangen water." 👨⚕-Dr. Horst Filtzer</h3>
      <h6>IN A SCIENTIFIC STUDY BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH, IT WAS DISCOVERED:</h6>
      <p>"The consumption of hydrogen rich water for 8 weeks resulted in a 39% increase (p < 0.05) in antioxidant enzyme
          superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a 43% decrease (p< 0.05) in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in
          urine. Further, subjects demonstrated an 8% increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and a 13%
          decrease in total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol from baseline to 4 weeks." 2 </p>

          </p>
          <h3>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</h3>
          <p>According to this study, those who drank hydrogen-rich water showed a substantial increase in their
            antioxidant enzymes and a massive decrease in acid in the urine. Further, participants showed a significant
            increase in HDL the "good cholesterol," and a significant decrease in the "bad cholesterol."
