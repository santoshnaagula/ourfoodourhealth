        <p class="text-center">Kangen means "return to origin" in Japanese. Kangen Water® is alkaline water produced by
          Enagic's alkaline
          ionizer and water filtration machines. For more than 40 years, Kangen Water® has been used in Japan to help
          restore the body to its original, alkaline state. These machines can transform your ordinary tap water into
          healthy, fresh tasting alkaline drinking water. Kangen Water® is superior to tap and purified water.

          <h3>Antioxidant (Hydrogen Rich) </h3>
          <p>Water that is Hydrogen rich has a high concentration of Molecular Hydrogen (H2). Molecular Hydrogen acts as
            an efficient antioxidant that diffuses rapidly across cell membranes and can reduce free radicals,
            suppressing oxidative stress.</p>
          <p>Through the process of electrolysis, your tap water becomes Hydrogen rich Kangen Water®. </p>
          <p>Oxidation reactions in the body can produce free radicals, while antioxidants terminate these reactions.
            Elevated rates of oxidants and insufficient antioxidants in the body cause oxidative stress. A constant
            supply of external sources of antioxidants should be part of one's daily diet, to reduce oxidative stress
            and related damage. This is why everyone should not only care about the quantity of the water we drink, but
            also about the quality. Both are essential for our wellbeing. </p>
          <p>Hydrogen rich water is characterised by exhibiting a negative ORP. A high ORP value (in positive numbers),
            indicates that a substance has a higher oxidizing potential. In generalised terms, for humans a positive or
            high ORP is better for the outside of the body (cleaning and sanitizing). A low ORP value (in negative
            numbers) indicates that a substance has a higher antioxidizing potential, and is preferred for oral
            consumption. Just like pH, ORP values are an important measurement for determining the quality of water.

          <p>As with most things in life, optimal health begins with balance. Our bodies must maintain a pH balance of
            7.365, which is slightly alkaline. A pH scale is used to determine whether a substance is acidic or
            alkaline. On this scale 7.0 is neutral. Anything above 7 is considered alkaline and anything below 7 is
            considered acidic. </p>

          <div class="col">
            <h3>Bottled water is bad for the environment</h3>
            <p>According to the National Geographic1, "Bottled water is a drain on the environment: The U.S. public goes
              through about 50 billion water bottles a year, and most of those plastic containers are not recycled.
              Transporting the bottles and keeping them cold also burns fossil fuels, which give off greenhouse gases."
            </p>
            <p>1500 plastic bottles are consumed every second. Enough plastic is thrown away each year to circle the
              earth
              four times. And, it will take 1000 years for the plastic to degrade.2 </p>
            <h3>• It's not proven to be any safer than tap water</h3>
            <p>The non-profit, non-partisan Environmental Working Group (EWG) says, "The government does not mandate
              that
              bottled water be any safer than tap water. In fact, the chemical pollution standards are nearly
              identical."
            </p>
            <p>Historically, bottled waters have even been recalled for contamination with particulate matter, mold and
              bacteria.4</p>

            <h3>• It can pose health threats</h3>
            <p>The plastic in bottled water often contains chemicals BPA and phthalates, which are proven to be

            <h1>NY Times: Tainted Tap Water in U.S. </h1>
            <p>Thirty-five years after the U.S. Congress passed the Safe Drinking Water Act, some regulators and
              environmentalists state the law is now so obsolete that it fails to protect people from the most obvious
              threats. </p>
            <p>In the USA, the NY Times reported on violations of the Clean Water Act, a federal law which governs water
              pollution, and has shown household water that is contaminated with lead, nickel, and other heavy metals.
              (Some extreme side-effects of this contamination have resulted in skin burns, rashes, and eroded tooth
              enamel).</p>
            <p>The NY Times has since compiled a database of violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act, finding 40% of
              the
              nation's community water systems in violation at least once, exposing millions to potentially harmful
              chemicals, toxins, and heavy metals.</p>

          <p>Kangen Water®... (aka electrolyzed reduced water (ERW), or hydrogen water) begins as tap water. The Enagic®
            machine filters out chlorine and other impurities from the tap water, then separates the hydrogen and oxygen
            with a process known as electrolysis. This process adds an electron to the hydrogen creating a new molecule
            called diatomic molecular hydrogen gas. When this is added to your drinking water, it produces
            antioxidant-rich Kangen Water®</p>
          <p>Oxidant, by definition, is an oxidizing agent, while antioxidant is any substance that acts to slow or
